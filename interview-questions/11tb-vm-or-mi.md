**SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS)** vs **Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)** depends on multiple dimensions:

---

## üîë Key Decision Factors

### 1. **Database Size & Limits**

* **Azure SQL MI** (General Purpose or Business Critical):

  * Max size per DB: **up to 16 TB** (with certain service tiers and storage configs).
  * 11 TB fits, but you need **premium storage** and cost will be **high**.
* **SQL Server on VM**:

  * Size is **limited only by VM + Azure storage**.
  * You can easily scale to **dozens of TBs**, no architectural restriction.

üëâ For 11 TB, **both options are possible**, but VM gives more headroom if growth is expected.

---

### 2. **Migration Method & Downtime**

* **To MI**:

  * Large migrations need **log shipping**, **Data Migration Service (DMS)**, or **Azure Data Sync**.
  * Cutover downtime can be **longer** for 11 TB unless you use a **near-zero downtime method** (like log shipping + cutover).
* **To VM**:

  * Easier: just backup/restore, or detach/attach, or log shipping to another SQL Server.
  * Downtime is easier to minimize and more predictable.

üëâ For 11 TB, **VM migration is simpler and faster**.

---

### 3. **Features & Compatibility**

* **SQL MI**:

  * Supports most SQL Server features, but **not all** (e.g., cross-instance linked servers, certain replication topologies, SSRS/SSIS/SSAS integration needs workarounds).
  * **Automatic patching, backups, HA built-in**.
* **SQL VM**:

  * Full feature parity with on-prem SQL.
  * You manage **patching, backups, HA/DR** yourself.

üëâ If you need **full SQL Server control and all features**, VM is safer.

---

### 4. **Performance & Maintenance**

* **MI**:

  * You get PaaS benefits: automated **backups, failover, patching**, zone redundancy.
  * IO throughput is capped based on service tier. An 11 TB DB needs **high vCores & storage** to avoid IO bottlenecks ‚Üí **expensive**.
* **VM**:

  * You size your VM and disks as you like.
  * More control over **TempDB, storage striping, instant file initialization**.
  * More tuning options for **large-scale workloads**.

üëâ For performance predictability at 11 TB, **VM is easier to tune**.

---

### 5. **Cost**

* **MI**:

  * Costs scale with **vCores + storage**.
  * Large DBs (11 TB) ‚Üí monthly costs can be **very high**.
* **VM**:

  * Cost depends on VM size + managed disks.
  * Usually **cheaper for very large DBs** than MI.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation for 11 TB DB

* If you want **full control, easier migration, and lower cost** ‚Üí **SQL Server on Azure VM**.
* If you want **PaaS, minimal admin, automatic HA/backup/patching** and can handle **higher cost & migration complexity** ‚Üí **Azure SQL Managed Instance**.

---

‚öñÔ∏è **Rule of Thumb**:

* **< 5 TB, fewer features required** ‚Üí go with **MI** (PaaS benefits).
* **> 10 TB, complex features, tighter migration window** ‚Üí go with **VM** (IaaS).

---

üëâ Since your DB is **11 TB**, I‚Äôd lean toward **SQL on Azure VM** unless you have strong business drivers to go PaaS.

Perfect üëç Let me build you a **deep comparison table** tailored for your **11 TB SQL Server database** migration choice between **Azure SQL VM** and **Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI)**:

# ‚úÖ Recommendation for 11 TB

* **Go with Azure SQL VM** if:

  * You want **simpler migration** (backup/restore/log shipping).
  * You need **full SQL Server features** (replication, SSRS, cross-linked servers).
  * You want to **control cost** for large storage.

* **Choose Managed Instance only if**:

  * Your business prioritizes **PaaS** (no ops overhead).
  * You can tolerate **higher costs**.
  * Your DB won‚Äôt grow much beyond **12‚Äì13 TB**.
