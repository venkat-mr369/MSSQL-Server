**how to address a Disk Full issue** in SQL Server. 

This is a common and critical problem, since when disks are full, SQL Server can‚Äôt grow data files, 
write to transaction logs, or even store tempdb activity. 

we will have a **step-by-step deep-dive**:

---

## üîé Step 1: Identify the Root Cause

A "disk full" issue can happen due to multiple reasons:

1. **Transaction log file (LDF) growth** ‚Äì log backups not running, long-running transactions, or misconfigured recovery model.
2. **Data file (MDF/NDF) growth** ‚Äì rapid data inserts, index fragmentation, large staging tables.
3. **TempDB growth** ‚Äì heavy sorts, spills to disk, or improper tempdb sizing.
4. **Other files on the drive** ‚Äì backups, dumps, error logs, non-SQL files consuming space.

Run:

```sql
EXEC xp_fixeddrives;  -- Shows free space in each drive
```

And:

```sql
DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE);  -- Log file usage per database
```

---

## üõ† Step 2: Immediate Quick Fix (to Resume Operations)

* **Free up space quickly**:

  * Move/delete old backup files from the SQL drives.
  * Clear SQL error logs (they rotate but can grow huge).
  * Shrink *only* if absolutely necessary (as a one-time emergency, not a routine).

Example:

```sql
DBCC SHRINKFILE (tempdev, 1000);  -- Only if tempdb is unreasonably large
```

* **Add additional disk space**:

  * Extend the drive from storage (SAN, VM, or cloud).
  * Attach a new disk and move non-critical files (backups, dumps) there.

---

## üìä Step 3: Address Transaction Log Issues

If the disk full issue is from **T-log growth**:

1. **Check recovery model**:

   ```sql
   SELECT name, recovery_model_desc FROM sys.databases;
   ```

   * If database is in **FULL** but no log backups exist ‚Üí the log never truncates.
   * Fix: Start regular log backups:

     ```sql
     BACKUP LOG MyDB TO DISK = 'E:\Backups\MyDB_log.trn';
     ```

2. **Long-running transactions**:

   ```sql
   DBCC OPENTRAN;  -- Shows oldest active transaction
   ```

   * Kill or commit the blocking transaction if possible.

3. **VLF fragmentation** ‚Äì too many Virtual Log Files ‚Üí consider shrinking and regrowing logs in proper chunks.

---

## üìä Step 4: Address Data File Growth

* If MDF/NDF are filling up the disk:

  * Purge/archive old data.
  * Partition large tables.
  * Move large indexes or data files to another drive:

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE MyDB 
    MODIFY FILE (NAME = MyDataFile, FILENAME = 'F:\SQLData\MyDataFile.ndf');
    ```
  * Rebuild indexes with compression if storage is limited.

---

## üìä Step 5: Address TempDB Growth

* TempDB can consume entire disk if spills occur:

  * Add multiple data files (1 per logical CPU up to 8).
  * Enable **Instant File Initialization**.
  * Monitor queries with heavy sorts, hash joins, or spills:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_query_memory_grants;
    ```
  * Regularly clear version store by managing long-running transactions in snapshot isolation.

---

## üö® Step 6: Prevent Future Disk Full

* **Monitoring & Alerts**:

  * Set up SQL Agent Alerts on low disk space.
  * Use Perfmon or Extended Events to track file growth.
* **Capacity planning**:

  * Enable auto-growth in MB, not %.
  * Keep 15‚Äì20% free space on SQL drives.
* **Backups & Maintenance**:

  * Implement backup retention policies (don‚Äôt leave weeks of backups on production drives).
  * Schedule index maintenance with compression.

---

‚úÖ **Rule of Thumb**:

* **Immediate fix** ‚Üí free space, shrink (only if critical).
* **Mid-term fix** ‚Üí proper backups, archiving, file moves.
* **Long-term fix** ‚Üí monitoring, capacity planning, and growth management.

 **deeper into T-Log specific disk full cases** (since that‚Äôs the most common cause)

 Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs do a **deep-dive into T-Log specific Disk Full cases** since that‚Äôs the **#1 cause of SQL disk full incidents**.

---

# üõ† SQL Server Transaction Log (T-Log) Disk Full Issue ‚Äì Deep Dive

---

## üîé Step 1: Understand Why T-Log Doesn‚Äôt Truncate

SQL Server log file doesn‚Äôt just grow indefinitely for fun ‚Äî it **waits until it can truncate**. Common blockers:

1. **No log backups** in FULL/BULK\_LOGGED recovery model ‚Üí log never clears.
2. **Active/long-running transactions** holding log space.
3. **Replication, CDC, or AlwaysOn** ‚Üí log must be retained until changes are synchronized.
4. **Open transactions from client apps** (even a BEGIN TRAN without COMMIT).
5. **High frequency of large operations** (bulk inserts, index rebuilds).

Check log status:

```sql
DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE);  -- log size & % used
```

---

## üîé Step 2: Diagnose the Cause

### 1. Check oldest open transaction

```sql
DBCC OPENTRAN;
```

* If you see "Oldest active transaction" ‚Üí commit/rollback it.

### 2. Check log reuse wait reason

```sql
SELECT name, log_reuse_wait_desc 
FROM sys.databases;
```

* **LOG\_BACKUP** ‚Üí no log backup taken.
* **ACTIVE\_TRANSACTION** ‚Üí open transaction.
* **REPLICATION** ‚Üí replication not synchronized.
* **AVAILABILITY\_REPLICA** ‚Üí AlwaysOn sync pending.

### 3. Check VLF count (too many Virtual Log Files slows recovery)

```sql
DBCC LOGINFO;   -- Old versions
DBCC LOGFILE;   -- Newer SQL versions
```

---

## üõ† Step 3: Immediate Fixes (Emergency)

1. **Take a log backup** (if in FULL recovery):

```sql
BACKUP LOG MyDB TO DISK = 'E:\Backups\MyDB_log.trn';
```

2. **Switch temporarily to SIMPLE recovery** (only if no point-in-time restore needed):

```sql
ALTER DATABASE MyDB SET RECOVERY SIMPLE;
DBCC SHRINKFILE (MyDB_log, 1024);
ALTER DATABASE MyDB SET RECOVERY FULL;
```

3. **Kill or commit blocking long transactions**:

```sql
KILL <spid>;
```

(Get spid from `sp_who2` or `sys.dm_exec_requests`.)

4. **Free disk space**:

   * Move/delete old backups.
   * Clear SQL error logs:

     ```sql
     EXEC sp_cycle_errorlog;
     ```
   * Temporarily move other non-critical files.

---

## üîé Step 4: Mid-Term Solutions

* **Re-size log properly**: Instead of shrinking to very small, size it once to a realistic value.
  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER DATABASE MyDB MODIFY FILE 
  (NAME = MyDB_log, SIZE = 8GB, FILEGROWTH = 512MB);
  ```
* **Set filegrowth in MB, not %** ‚Üí avoids unexpected massive growths.
* **Place log on a separate disk** (fast IOPS, ideally SSD).
* **Implement regular log backups** if in FULL recovery:

  * Every 15 min for OLTP systems.
  * Every 5 min for mission-critical systems.

---

## üîé Step 5: Long-Term Prevention

1. **Automate Monitoring**:

   * SQL Agent Alerts when log file >80% full.
   * Perfmon: `SQLServer:Databases(Log File(s) Used Size (KB))`.

2. **Capacity Planning**:

   * Estimate daily log generation using backups.
   * Plan disk capacity for at least **7x daily growth**.

3. **For AlwaysOn/Replication**:

   * Monitor sync latency.
   * Don‚Äôt let replicas lag ‚Üí log can‚Äôt truncate until sync completes.

4. **Application Best Practices**:

   * Avoid uncommitted open transactions in app code.
   * Use batching for large inserts instead of one giant transaction.

---

‚úÖ **Golden Rules**:

* Never use `DBCC SHRINKFILE` as a daily habit ‚Üí only in emergencies.
* Always size log files **once properly** and manage with **backups + monitoring**.
* For HA/DR environments, ensure replication/AG is healthy, otherwise truncation is blocked.
