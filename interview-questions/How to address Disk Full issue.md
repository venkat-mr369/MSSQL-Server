**how to address a Disk Full issue** in SQL Server. 
This is a common and critical problem, since when disks are full, SQL Server can‚Äôt grow data files, 
write to transaction logs, or even store tempdb activity. 

we will have a **step-by-step deep-dive**:

---

## üîé Step 1: Identify the Root Cause

A "disk full" issue can happen due to multiple reasons:

1. **Transaction log file (LDF) growth** ‚Äì log backups not running, long-running transactions, or misconfigured recovery model.
2. **Data file (MDF/NDF) growth** ‚Äì rapid data inserts, index fragmentation, large staging tables.
3. **TempDB growth** ‚Äì heavy sorts, spills to disk, or improper tempdb sizing.
4. **Other files on the drive** ‚Äì backups, dumps, error logs, non-SQL files consuming space.

Run:

```sql
EXEC xp_fixeddrives;  -- Shows free space in each drive
```

And:

```sql
DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE);  -- Log file usage per database
```

---

## üõ† Step 2: Immediate Quick Fix (to Resume Operations)

* **Free up space quickly**:

  * Move/delete old backup files from the SQL drives.
  * Clear SQL error logs (they rotate but can grow huge).
  * Shrink *only* if absolutely necessary (as a one-time emergency, not a routine).

Example:

```sql
DBCC SHRINKFILE (tempdev, 1000);  -- Only if tempdb is unreasonably large
```

* **Add additional disk space**:

  * Extend the drive from storage (SAN, VM, or cloud).
  * Attach a new disk and move non-critical files (backups, dumps) there.

---

## üìä Step 3: Address Transaction Log Issues

If the disk full issue is from **T-log growth**:

1. **Check recovery model**:

   ```sql
   SELECT name, recovery_model_desc FROM sys.databases;
   ```

   * If database is in **FULL** but no log backups exist ‚Üí the log never truncates.
   * Fix: Start regular log backups:

     ```sql
     BACKUP LOG MyDB TO DISK = 'E:\Backups\MyDB_log.trn';
     ```

2. **Long-running transactions**:

   ```sql
   DBCC OPENTRAN;  -- Shows oldest active transaction
   ```

   * Kill or commit the blocking transaction if possible.

3. **VLF fragmentation** ‚Äì too many Virtual Log Files ‚Üí consider shrinking and regrowing logs in proper chunks.

---

## üìä Step 4: Address Data File Growth

* If MDF/NDF are filling up the disk:

  * Purge/archive old data.
  * Partition large tables.
  * Move large indexes or data files to another drive:

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE MyDB 
    MODIFY FILE (NAME = MyDataFile, FILENAME = 'F:\SQLData\MyDataFile.ndf');
    ```
  * Rebuild indexes with compression if storage is limited.

---

## üìä Step 5: Address TempDB Growth

* TempDB can consume entire disk if spills occur:

  * Add multiple data files (1 per logical CPU up to 8).
  * Enable **Instant File Initialization**.
  * Monitor queries with heavy sorts, hash joins, or spills:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_query_memory_grants;
    ```
  * Regularly clear version store by managing long-running transactions in snapshot isolation.

---

## üö® Step 6: Prevent Future Disk Full

* **Monitoring & Alerts**:

  * Set up SQL Agent Alerts on low disk space.
  * Use Perfmon or Extended Events to track file growth.
* **Capacity planning**:

  * Enable auto-growth in MB, not %.
  * Keep 15‚Äì20% free space on SQL drives.
* **Backups & Maintenance**:

  * Implement backup retention policies (don‚Äôt leave weeks of backups on production drives).
  * Schedule index maintenance with compression.

---

‚úÖ **Rule of Thumb**:

* **Immediate fix** ‚Üí free space, shrink (only if critical).
* **Mid-term fix** ‚Üí proper backups, archiving, file moves.
* **Long-term fix** ‚Üí monitoring, capacity planning, and growth management.
