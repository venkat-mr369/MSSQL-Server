**migrating large on-prem SQL Server databases to Azure SQL Database (PaaS) with minimal downtime**.

---

## üîπ What is NOT possible

* You **cannot** do native `BACKUP DATABASE ‚Ä¶ RESTORE` like in SQL Server / Managed Instance.
* You **cannot** do `NORECOVERY` style restores (no log shipping).
* You **cannot** directly migrate Windows logins ‚Äî only SQL logins or convert to AAD.

So **methods like copy-only backup + restore, or log shipping** are **NOT supported** for Azure SQL Database.

---

## üîπ What IS correct

The supported minimal downtime methods are:

### ‚úÖ **1. Azure DMS (Online Mode)**

* **This is the official Microsoft-recommended method** for near zero downtime.
* Steps:

  1. Run **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** ‚Üí fix schema incompatibility.
  2. Provision Azure SQL Database (target).
  3. Provision **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)** in Azure.
  4. Create **Online Migration Project** ‚Üí On-prem SQL = source, Azure SQL DB = target.
  5. DMS bulk loads schema + data, then keeps syncing changes continuously.
  6. At cutover ‚Üí stop writes on source, let sync catch up, finalize migration.
* **Downtime = just cutover time (minutes).**

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Transactional Replication (if schema supports)**

* Azure SQL Database can act as a **replication subscriber**.
* On-prem SQL = Publisher ‚Üí replicate data continuously.
* At cutover, switch app to Azure SQL DB.
* **Downtime = seconds‚Äìminutes**.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è But not all schema objects are supported.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Azure SQL Data Sync**

* Can sync selected tables between on-prem and Azure SQL DB.
* Not full DB migration, but helps reduce downtime in **incremental sync scenarios**.
* Best for **partial workloads**.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. BACPAC (Offline + Delta Sync with ADF/SSIS)**

* Export/import BACPAC to seed DB in Azure.
* Then use **ADF/SSIS incremental load jobs** to sync changes.
* Final cutover ‚Üí apply last delta + switch.
* **Downtime = higher (hours)** ‚Üí not ideal for very large DBs.

---

## üîπ Double-Checked Conclusion

üëâ For **big SQL databases ‚Üí Azure SQL Database with minimal downtime**:

* **Best method = Azure DMS Online Migration** (keeps changes synced, downtime = minutes).
* **Alternative = Transactional Replication** (if schema supports).
* **Other methods (BACPAC, Data Sync)** = more downtime, suitable for smaller or special cases.

---

‚úÖ So the earlier answer was **correct**.
No native backup/restore/log shipping ‚Üí only **DMS Online** or **Replication** give you **minimal downtime**.
