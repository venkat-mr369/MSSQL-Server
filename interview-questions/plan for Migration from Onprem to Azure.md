**migration from On-Prem SQL Server to Azure** is a **big exercise**, and it must be approached like a **project** with multiple stages (assessment â†’ planning â†’ migration â†’ validation â†’ optimization). 

Iâ€™ll give you a **deep-dive migration framework** with **step-by-step phases, decision points, tools, risks, and best practices**.

---

# ðŸ”Ž 1. Migration Approaches

First, you need to decide **what type of Azure SQL service** you are migrating to.

### Options:

* **IaaS (VM)** â†’ SQL Server installed on Azure VM (lift & shift).
* **PaaS (Azure SQL Managed Instance)** â†’ nearly full SQL Server engine, supports most on-prem features.
* **PaaS (Azure SQL Database)** â†’ single DB or elastic pool, lightweight, but limited features.
* **PaaS (Azure SQL Hyperscale)** â†’ for very large DB (>4TB).

ðŸ‘‰ Decision depends on: size (TBs), features (cross-database queries, linked servers, SQL Agent jobs, Service Broker, CLR, replication), performance requirements, compliance.

# ðŸ”Ž 2. Migration Plan (Step-by-Step)

## **Phase 1: Assessment**

1. **Inventory** all SQL instances and databases.

   * Size, growth rate, high availability config (AlwaysOn, Log shipping, Mirroring).
   * Dependencies (SSIS, SSRS, linked servers, agent jobs, replication).
2. **Compatibility check** with **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)**.

   ```plaintext
   - Detects feature parity issues (e.g., cross-db queries, unsupported TDE versions).
   - Gives remediation guidance.
   ```
3. **Performance baseline** â†’ Capture current CPU, IO, query response times. (Use DMVs, Perfmon, or Query Store).
4. **Connectivity mapping** â†’ List all apps/users connecting, auth methods (SQL vs AD).

---

## **Phase 2: Strategy**

1. **Choose Azure Target**

   * If you need full feature compatibility â†’ **Managed Instance**.
   * If simple DB-only workloads â†’ **Azure SQL Database**.
   * If lift & shift with minimal change â†’ **SQL Server on Azure VM**.
2. **Select Migration Method** (depends on downtime tolerance):

   * **Backup/Restore to Azure Blob** (good for <1TB, downtime required).
   * **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)** for minimal downtime migrations.
   * **Log Shipping or Transactional Replication** for phased cutovers.
   * **Managed Instance Link** (SQL 2022+ only) for real-time migration.
3. **Define Downtime Window** â†’ Plan if cutover can be weekend or zero-downtime required.
4. **Networking & Security Plan** â†’ VNET, firewall, private endpoints, NSGs.
5. **HA/DR Plan** in Azure â†’ Geo-replication, Failover groups, Zone-redundancy.

---

## **Phase 3: Migration Preparation**

1. **Provision Azure Resources**

   * Create Azure SQL MI / SQL VM / Database.
   * Configure storage, compute, networking.
   * Enable backups, monitoring (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics).
2. **Prepare Security**

   * Set up Azure AD authentication.
   * Configure firewalls, subnets, NSGs.
3. **Pre-migration tasks**

   * Take full backups on-prem.
   * Test connectivity from on-prem to Azure.
   * Validate logins, roles, certificates, agent jobs.
4. **Test dry run** with smaller DBs or staging environment.

---

## **Phase 4: Migration Execution**

### Option A â€” Full Backup & Restore via Azure Blob (downtime)

```sql
-- On Prem: Backup to Azure Blob
BACKUP DATABASE SalesDB 
TO URL = 'https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/sqlbackups/SalesDB.bak'
WITH CREDENTIAL = 'AzureBlobCredential';
```

```sql
-- On Azure: Restore
RESTORE DATABASE SalesDB 
FROM URL = 'https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/sqlbackups/SalesDB.bak';
```

### Option B â€” Azure Database Migration Service (online migration)

* Use DMS to continuously sync data from on-prem to Azure until cutover.
* Final cutover = stop applications â†’ sync delta â†’ switch connection string.

### Option C â€” Managed Instance Link (for SQL 2022 â†’ Azure MI)

* Near-zero downtime with real-time replication.

## **Phase 5: Post-Migration Validation**

1. **Validate Schema** â€” Compare with tools like Redgate, SQL Compare.
2. **Validate Data** â€” Row counts, checksum verification.
3. **Validate Logins & Security** â€” Map logins to users (`sp_change_users_login` or `ALTER USER ... WITH LOGIN`).
4. **Validate Performance** â€” Compare against baseline: query duration, waits, IO.
5. **Application Testing** â€” Test connectivity, workloads, reports, jobs.
6. **Failover Testing** â€” If using HA/DR, test geo-failover or AG listener.

---

## **Phase 6: Optimization**

1. **Performance Tuning**

   * Check Query Store for regressions.
   * Use automatic plan correction in Azure SQL.
   * Create missing indexes (reviewed).
2. **Cost Optimization**

   * Right-size DTU/vCores.
   * Enable auto-pause for dev/test DBs.
   * Configure auto-scaling.
3. **Security Hardening**

   * Enable TDE (Transparent Data Encryption).
   * Enable auditing (Azure SQL Auditing, Defender for SQL).
   * Enforce TLS encryption for connections.

---

# ðŸ”Ž 3. Use Case Example

**Company:** `corp.example.com` has 5 on-prem SQL Server instances (2TB OLTP, 500GB reporting, 300GB HR).

* Decision: Move OLTP & HR to **Azure SQL Managed Instance** (for cross-db queries + Agent jobs).
* Reporting DB goes to **Azure SQL Database Hyperscale** (for read-scale).
* Migration Method: **Azure DMS (online)** to minimize downtime.
* Cutover Plan: Weekend downtime of 2 hours, finalize sync, repoint apps to `sqlmi.corp.database.windows.net`.
* Post-Migration: Validate security (Azure AD), enable automatic tuning, configure geo-replication.

âœ… Result: Apps migrated with <2 hrs downtime, old hardware decommissioned, reduced licensing cost with Azure Hybrid Benefit.

# âœ… Summary

* **Assessment** â†’ Inventory + DMA + Baseline.
* **Strategy** â†’ Choose Azure target + migration method + downtime plan.
* **Preparation** â†’ Provision resources + security + dry run.
* **Migration** â†’ Backup/restore, DMS, or Managed Instance Link.
* **Validation** â†’ Schema, data, logins, performance, apps.
* **Optimization** â†’ Performance, cost, security.
