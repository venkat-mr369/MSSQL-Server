**step-by-step assessment plan** for SQL Server **Always On Availability Groups (AG)** with this setup:

* **Region 1 (East)**

  * **Node1** (Primary)
  * **Node2** (Secondary ‚Äì synchronous commit, automatic failover)

* **Region 2 (West)**

  * **Node3** (DR ‚Äì asynchronous commit, manual failover)

This is a **classic high availability + disaster recovery (HA+DR)** design.
we will break the **assessment steps** into **phases** with **in-depth details**, so we can map Node1, Node2, and Node3 properly.

---

## üîç General Steps for Assessment ()

### **1. Infrastructure & Network Assessment**

* **Node1 (East ‚Äì Primary)**

  * Verify OS, SQL Server edition (Enterprise required for multi-node AG).
  * Check CPU, RAM, Storage IOPS.
  * Ensure local disks are high performance (SSD/NVMe).

* **Node2 (East ‚Äì HA Secondary)**

  * Same build/version as Node1.
  * Network latency between Node1 and Node2 must be **<1ms** for synchronous commit.
  * Validate that this node is in **same subnet/region** for automatic failover.

* **Node3 (West ‚Äì DR Node)**

  * Same SQL Server edition/version/patch level.
  * Validate network bandwidth between East ‚Üî West (latency usually **>10ms**).
  * Should be **async commit** to avoid latency impact on OLTP.

‚úÖ **Checks:**

* Firewall ports open (1433, 5022 for HADR endpoint).
* DNS/Active Directory replication across regions.
* Validate Windows Failover Cluster communication across subnets.

---

### **2. Windows Failover Cluster (WSFC) Readiness**

* Run **Cluster Validation Wizard** on Node1, Node2, Node3.
* Decide on **quorum configuration**:

  * With 3 nodes across 2 regions ‚Üí Use **Node Majority + File Share Witness**.
  * Place the witness in Region1 (East) or a neutral 3rd region (cloud).

‚úÖ **Checks:**

* All nodes must see the witness.
* Proper heartbeat and cluster communication between East ‚Üî West.

---

### **3. SQL Server Configuration Assessment**

* Verify **SQL Server Always On feature enabled** on all nodes.

* Endpoints:

  * Node1: `TCP://node1.east:5022`
  * Node2: `TCP://node2.east:5022`
  * Node3: `TCP://node3.west:5022`

* Security:

  * Use same SQL service account across nodes (or domain account).
  * Endpoints must allow mutual authentication.

* Database readiness:

  * All DBs must be **Full Recovery Model**.
  * Initial full backup + log backup restored (WITH NORECOVERY) on Node2 and Node3.

---

### **4. Availability Group Design**

* **Node1 (Primary, East):**

  * Synchronous commit, automatic failover with Node2.
  * Role: Production OLTP.

* **Node2 (Secondary, East):**

  * Synchronous commit, automatic failover.
  * Can be used for **read-only routing** / backups.

* **Node3 (DR, West):**

  * Asynchronous commit, manual failover.
  * Used for DR testing or reporting workload.

‚úÖ **Checks:**

* AG listener DNS entries replicate across regions.
* Application connection strings use **MultiSubnetFailover=True**.
* Read-only routing list configured for reporting workloads.

---

### **5. Failover & DR Testing Plan**

* **Node1 ‚Üí Node2 (in East):**

  * Test automatic failover.
  * Check data consistency and client reconnection.

* **Node1 ‚Üí Node3 (East ‚Üí West):**

  * Test manual failover (planned/unplanned).
  * Validate RPO (data loss) when async.
  * Measure failover time (RTO).

* **Node2/Node3 ‚Üí Node1 back failback:**

  * Validate that primary role can be restored without issues.

---

### **6. Monitoring & Maintenance**

* Configure **AG dashboard** for health.
* Enable **Extended Events** for failover tracking.
* Monitor network latency (Node1/2 ‚Üî Node3).
* Configure backups:

  * Primary DB backups OR offload to Node2/Node3.

---

### **7. Risk & Gap Analysis**

* **Quorum Risk:** If Region1 goes down fully (Node1+Node2), DR Node3 cannot form quorum unless witness is properly placed.
* **Split Brain Risk:** Ensure cluster heartbeat properly configured.
* **Licensing:** Enterprise edition required for multi-region AG.

‚úÖ **Summary Mapping (East vs West)**

| Node  | Region | Commit Mode       | Failover Type | Usage                |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Node1 | East   | Primary (Sync)    | Automatic     | OLTP / Main Prod     |
| Node2 | East   | Secondary (Sync)  | Automatic     | HA partner / Reports |
| Node3 | West   | Secondary (Async) | Manual        | DR / Reporting       |

### üïí Transaction Timeline Example

#### üü¢ **Scenario**: An application inserts a record

```sql
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, Item) VALUES (1001, 'Laptop');
```

---

### **T1 ‚Äì Client Sends Transaction**

* The app sends the SQL statement to **Node1 (Primary)**.
* Node1 parses, optimizes, and starts execution.

---

### **T2 ‚Äì Log Record Creation**

* Node1 generates a **transaction log record** for this insert.
* Log record is stored in **Log Buffer** (memory).
* Before commit ‚Üí SQL must **harden the log**.

---

### **T3 ‚Äì Send Log Block to Secondaries**

* Log block (\~60KB unit) is shipped from Node1 ‚Üí

  * **Node2 (East, Sync)** via HADR endpoint (TCP 5022).
  * **Node3 (West, Async)** at the same time.

---

### **T4 ‚Äì Node2 Hardens Log (Sync Commit)**

* Node2 receives the log block.
* Node2 writes it to **its own log file (.ldf)** on disk.
* Once written ‚Üí Node2 sends **ACK (Acknowledgement)** back to Node1.

‚ö° This ACK must be received before Node1 commits.

---

### **T5 ‚Äì Node3 Buffers Log (Async Commit)**

* Node3 receives the log block.
* Writes to its **redo queue** (but Node1 doesn‚Äôt wait).
* If WAN latency = 40ms, Node3 may receive it later.

‚ö†Ô∏è If Node1 crashes **before Node3 applies the log**, that data is lost.

---

### **T6 ‚Äì Node1 Commits Transaction**

* After receiving **ACK from Node2**, Node1 hardens its log.
* Node1 returns **‚ÄúTransaction Committed‚Äù** to the client.

‚úÖ At this moment:

* Node1 and Node2 both have the change.
* Node3 may or may not have received it yet.

---

### **T7 ‚Äì Redo Phase**

* Node2 replays the log record from redo queue ‚Üí updates `Orders` table.
* Node3 replays slightly later, once it has the log record.
* Eventually ‚Üí all nodes show the same data.

---

## üîÄ Failover Timeline Scenarios

### Case A: Node1 crashes **after T6**

* Node2 has the change (sync).
* Cluster fails over to Node2 automatically.
* No data loss.

---

### Case B: Node1 crashes **before T4 ACK**

* Transaction never committed.
* Node2 rolls back uncommitted log.
* No data loss.

---

### Case C: Node1 crashes **after T6 but before Node3 receives log**

* Node3 is behind (async).
* If forced failover to Node3 ‚Üí

  * The last few transactions (not shipped yet) are **lost**.
* RPO > 0 (data loss possible).

---

## üìä Timeline Visualization

```
T1: App ‚Üí Node1 (Start Transaction)
T2: Node1 generates log record
T3: Node1 sends log ‚Üí Node2(sync), Node3(async)
T4: Node2 hardens log, sends ACK
T5: Node3 receives log later (WAN latency)
T6: Node1 commits transaction (after ACK from Node2)
T7: Node2 + Node3 redo log into data pages
```

---

‚úÖ **Key Note**

* **Node2 (sync):** Guarantees durability ‚Üí no data loss.
* **Node3 (async):** Faster for Node1, but may lag ‚Üí possible data loss during DR failover.
* **Client always waits for Node2‚Äôs ACK but not Node3‚Äôs.**
